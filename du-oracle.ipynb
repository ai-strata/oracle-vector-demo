Countries are creating BIM Strategies to increase the performance of the industry as well as the governance, maturity and transparency. However, the industry has been known for its very dynamic ecosystem and a large number of dispute areas that make information validity very crucial as a key stone for any transformational initiative. Blockchain, on the other hand, has been famous since int roduced in 2008 with the promise of creating new norms within the Digital Economy, and unlocking the potential of other technologies and business models in many industries, however, it still in the very early stages of implementation and maturity in the industry. This paper reviews the potential of adopting Blockchain Technology with BIM concepts in the built environment. It defines the technology and review its key value proposition from BIM perspectives. Keywords: Building Information Model, Blockcha in, BIM Maturity , Smart Contracts , IFC , Collaboration, Trust 1. Introduction BIM has been of significant benefits on many aspects of the construction industry such as collective design intentions understanding, conflicts reduction, quality improvement, faster and predictable cost management (Yang and Chou, 2019) . Many countries created implementation strategies (Smith, 2014) and UK put a mandate for BIM Level 2 adoption on public projects (Eynon, 2016) believing that adopting BIM collaborative environments and technologies is essential in cost saving, adding to that the effort of the European Union moving towards BIM Level 3 (Eynon, 2016) which ent ails full collaborative process, and one of the pillars of their long term strategy is fostering digital ecosystem and infrastructure from regulation and physical perspectives, to support collaboration and trust. However, from process perspectives, BIM implementations faces obstacles, such as , preserving BIM model historical modifications log (Kerosuo et al. , 2015) , real time collaboration and integration for co -design, interoperability difficulties resulting from the lack of standard communication specifications for BIM models sharing , and exposure to data leakage or manipulation (Nawari and Ravindran, 2019a) , tracing liabilities and responsibilities , and preserving IP rights and privacy (Turk and Kl inc, 2017) . Moreover, the information output and timelines, permissions for model modifications, and how all of this can be governed contractually to support the BIM process was of question (Mcadam, 2010) . From legal perspectives, there is a lack of legal frameworks that detail mod el information and data ownership as well as contractual aspects (Ahn, Kwak and Suk, 2016) . Responsibilities and rights clarity, also the ownership of m odel information and the protection of IPR was the most issue mentioned by researchers (Fan et al. , 2018) . On the ICT side, there was the question back then whether project’s participant should use the same BIM environment or not (Mcadam, 2010) , if not, how reliable will be the interoperability between different BIM soft ware, and the reliability of each individual ones, and how the software limitation can be put in the supply agreement. Apparently, the same question remains as (Fan et al., 2018) identified BIM and procurement systems incompatibility among the issue s mentioned in research papers.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='1e992c2b5b22f70c94788ae139a4b201ef213835b40a1ebf893689eaf8314d5d', embedding=None, metadata={'file_name': 'blockchain_paper.pdf', 'page_label': '5'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text=\"1.5. Why Permissioned Blockchain Adding to the decision chart in Figure 1, a typical construction project of any size have known participants who basically have signed contracts (Nawari and Ravindran, 2019b) , in addition, Public Blockchains (Permission -less) lack the privacy as all participants have visibility to all transactions data, and also lack centralized management which places the control of the consensus to the Blockchain protocol and this is against the nature of the industry, unless the use case requires public consensus like Intellectual Property use cases. 2. BIM and Blockchain Blockchain from its definition has no update or delete in it, this natu re enabled other capabilities in the construction industry from transparency, traceability and collaboration (Balint Penzes, 2018) . This section highlight s on the Blockc hain potential with BIM from the angel of these three features along with the interoperability between BIM and Blockchain . 2.1. Interoperability On the model information level, using Industry Foundation Classes ( IFC) BIM and Blockchain can be mapped, (Xue and Lu, 2020) used IFC semantics to introduce an approach to minimize information redundan cy of BIM changes over time, mapping BIM onto Blockchain , as in Figure 3 . Figure 3:Integrating BIM and Blockchain using IFC semantic interoperability (Xue and Lu, 2020) From BIM process perspective, having the employer requirement as the center of attention is very essential, and this is why project's requirements and its information delivery milestones must be governed. In their research, (Raslan et al. , 2020) proposed a framework to use Blockchain smart contracts to match the Employer Information Requirements ( EIR) with what the suppliers and contractors needs to comply with, creating a Blockchain structure to store graphical models, non -graphical information and links to documentation, matching them all to the Asset Information Model (AIM).\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='353431fd2fb86085c056f1995ab07e55f185421b1a009065941e510ae67bdb00', embedding=None, metadata={'file_name': 'blockchain_paper.pdf', 'page_label': '4'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={}, text='1.2.4. Peers Peers represents organizations (Yang et al. , 2020) their roles are to e xecut e a transaction proposal, validat e transaction s. Each Peer has a copy of the smart contracts and the immutable ledger (HyperledgerDocs, 2018) . 1.3. What is BIM Among all the definitions and references for BIM, and for the purpose of this paper, stating that “With BIM, you design with objects, not lines, arcs, and shapes ” (Autodesk, 2015) could be of the best interest , the word “objects” represents everything of any size or magnitude varying from a small window or door to even a complex Jet Engine. 1.4. Why Blockchain in C onstruction and Why with BIM Bridging the gap between Blockchain and Construction industry relies on certain principles , (Greenspan, 2015) suggested eight main principles to identify whether the usage of Blockchain for certain business case is viable or not , which are the need for centralized database, presence of m ultiple writers, no trust among writers , the need to eliminate 3rd parties , functionality control, rules setting , need for v alidators, and the presence of an a sset to be tracked . (Turk and Klinc, 2017) used these principles to draw a decision chart (Figure 2 ) to confirm that building projects have the typical needs for collaboration, types of transactions and also the need for responsibility and accountability management that make the use of Blockchain ideal for the industry. BIM aims at exchanging information digitally , creating a single source for data originally created and shared by stakeholders during the construction phases (Di Giuda et al. , 2020) . Transactions in building projects and the legal effects resulting from failures are typical cases to apply Blockchain as the stakeholders are already known, i t is not guaranteed that they completely trust each other, data writers’ interest are not unified, third parties are not preferred and the functionality control is required as it is defined by the stakeholders, all transaction must be within the transacting parties and finally, c onsensus is defined bet ween stakeholders (Turk and Klinc, 2017) .

BIM also can encapsulate Blockchain verified supply chain information, material tracking records or payment information (Balint Penzes, 2018) , it can also give back model changes information and approvals. Also making use of Blockchain smart contracts, payments can be initiated based on other Blockchain triggers like inspection completion for specific activities (Moreira, Mota and Machado, 2021) . 2.2. Transparency With its immutable record keeping capability, all records are written according to a predefined and agreed upon consensus mechanism between participants, (Nawari and Ravindran, 2019b) stated that DLT’s transparency along with BIM properties can present an 'proof of trust', which would make another incentive for th e AEC business. As an example for transparency, In their research, (Nawari and Ravindran, 2019b) introduced a Blockchain+BIM framework for compliance and code -check automation of the review and submission of construction permits . 2.3. Traceability ( Provenance ) There is a major data loss problem in the construction indu stry (Branner, 2017) as 95% of data is either thrown out or not even collected .

      "Retrieved context: The potential of adopting Blockchain Technology with BIM Implementations in the Construction Industry Ecosystem –A Review Paper Ahmed H Abdelghany ah2028@hw.ac.uk Abstract: Building Information Model (BIM) has been a mainstream concept within the Construction Industry for more than a decade. Countries are creating BIM Strategies to increase the performance of the industry as well as the governance, maturity and transparency. However, the industry has been known for its very dynamic ecosystem and a large number of dispute areas that make information validity very crucial as a key stone for any transformational initiative. Blockchain, on the other hand, has been famous since int roduced in 2008 with the promise of creating new norms within the Digital Economy, and unlocking the potential of other technologies and business models in many industries, however, it still in the very early stages of implementation and maturity in the industry. This paper reviews the potential of adopting Blockchain Technology with BIM concepts in the built environment. It defines the technology and review its key value proposition from BIM perspectives. Keywords: Building Information Model, Blockcha in, BIM Maturity , Smart Contracts , IFC , Collaboration, Trust 1. Introduction BIM has been of significant benefits on many aspects of the construction industry such as collective design intentions understanding, conflicts reduction, quality improvement, faster and predictable cost management (Yang and Chou, 2019) . Many countries created implementation strategies (Smith, 2014) and UK put a mandate for BIM Level 2 adoption on public projects (Eynon, 2016) believing that adopting BIM collaborative environments and technologies is essential in cost saving, adding to that the effort of the European Union moving towards BIM Level 3 (Eynon, 2016) which ent ails full collaborative process, and one of the pillars of their long term strategy is fostering digital ecosystem and infrastructure from regulation and physical perspectives, to support collaboration and trust. However, from process perspectives, BIM implementations faces obstacles, such as , preserving BIM model historical modifications log (Kerosuo et al. , 2015) , real time collaboration and integration for co -design, interoperability difficulties resulting from the lack of standard communication specifications for BIM models sharing , and exposure to data leakage or manipulation (Nawari and Ravindran, 2019a) , tracing liabilities and responsibilities , and preserving IP rights and privacy (Turk and Kl inc, 2017) . Moreover, the information output and timelines, permissions for model modifications, and how all of this can be governed contractually to support the BIM process was of question (Mcadam, 2010) . From legal perspectives, there is a lack of legal frameworks that detail mod el information and data ownership as well as contractual aspects (Ahn, Kwak and Suk, 2016) . Responsibilities and rights clarity, also the ownership of m odel information and the protection of IPR was the most issue mentioned by researchers (Fan et al. , 2018) . On the ICT side, there was the question back then whether project’s participant should use the same BIM environment or not (Mcadam, 2010) , if not, how reliable will be the interoperability between different BIM soft ware, and the reliability of each individual ones, and how the software limitation can be put in the supply agreement. Apparently, the same question remains as (Fan et al., 2018) identified BIM and procurement systems incompatibility among the issue s mentioned in research papers. {'file_name': 'blockchain_paper.pdf', 'page_label': '2'} 1.5. Why Permissioned Blockchain Adding to the decision chart in Figure 1, a typical construction project of any size have known participants who basically have signed contracts (Nawari and Ravindran, 2019b) , in addition, Public Blockchains (Permission -less) lack the privacy as all participants have visibility to all transactions data, and also lack centralized management which places the control of the consensus to the Blockchain protocol and this is against the nature of the industry, unless the use case requires public consensus like Intellectual Property use cases. 2. BIM and Blockchain Blockchain from its definition has no update or delete in it, this natu re enabled other capabilities in the construction industry from transparency, traceability and collaboration (Balint Penzes, 2018) . This section highlight s on the Blockc hain potential with BIM from the angel of these three features along with the interoperability between BIM and Blockchain . 2.1. Interoperability On the model information level, using Industry Foundation Classes ( IFC) BIM and Blockchain can be mapped, (Xue and Lu, 2020) used IFC semantics to introduce an approach to minimize information redundan cy of BIM changes over time, mapping BIM onto Blockchain , as in Figure 3 . Figure 3:Integrating BIM and Blockchain using IFC semantic interoperability (Xue and Lu, 2020) From BIM process perspective, having the employer requirement as the center of attention is very essential, and this is why project's requirements and its information delivery milestones must be governed. In their research, (Raslan et al. , 2020) proposed a framework to use Blockchain smart contracts to match the Employer Information Requirements ( EIR) with what the suppliers and contractors needs to comply with, creating a Blockchain structure to store graphical models, non -graphical information and links to documentation, matching them all to the Asset Information Model (AIM). {'file_name': 'blockchain_paper.pdf', 'page_label': '5'} 1.2.4. Peers Peers represents organizations (Yang et al. , 2020) their roles are to e xecut e a transaction proposal, validat e transaction s. Each Peer has a copy of the smart contracts and the immutable ledger (HyperledgerDocs, 2018) . 1.3. What is BIM Among all the definitions and references for BIM, and for the purpose of this paper, stating that “With BIM, you design with objects, not lines, arcs, and shapes ” (Autodesk, 2015) could be of the best interest , the word “objects” represents everything of any size or magnitude varying from a small window or door to even a complex Jet Engine. 1.4. Why Blockchain in C onstruction and Why with BIM Bridging the gap between Blockchain and Construction industry relies on certain principles , (Greenspan, 2015) suggested eight main principles to identify whether the usage of Blockchain for certain business case is viable or not , which are the need for centralized database, presence of m ultiple writers, no trust among writers , the need to eliminate 3rd parties , functionality control, rules setting , need for v alidators, and the presence of an a sset to be tracked . (Turk and Klinc, 2017) used these principles to draw a decision chart (Figure 2 ) to confirm that building projects have the typical needs for collaboration, types of transactions and also the need for responsibility and accountability management that make the use of Blockchain ideal for the industry. BIM aims at exchanging information digitally , creating a single source for data originally created and shared by stakeholders during the construction phases (Di Giuda et al. , 2020) . Transactions in building projects and the legal effects resulting from failures are typical cases to apply Blockchain as the stakeholders are already known, i t is not guaranteed that they completely trust each other, data writers’ interest are not unified, third parties are not preferred and the functionality control is required as it is defined by the stakeholders, all transaction must be within the transacting parties and finally, c onsensus is defined bet ween stakeholders (Turk and Klinc, 2017) . Figure 2, A decision t ree to determine the type of Blockchain to use. (Turk and Klinc, 2017) {'file_name': 'blockchain_paper.pdf', 'page_label': '4'} Figure 4: Optimizing Asset & Facilities Management team exp erience (Raslan et al. , 2020) There is an interesting correlation between Blockchain and AIM and BIM which gives a potential for each technology to fill each other’s gap (Raslan et al. , 2020) . BIM also can encapsulate Blockchain verified supply chain information, material tracking records or payment information (Balint Penzes, 2018) , it can also give back model changes information and approvals. Also making use of Blockchain smart contracts, payments can be initiated based on other Blockchain triggers like inspection completion for specific activities (Moreira, Mota and Machado, 2021) . 2.2. Transparency With its immutable record keeping capability, all records are written according to a predefined and agreed upon consensus mechanism between participants, (Nawari and Ravindran, 2019b) stated that DLT’s transparency along with BIM properties can present an 'proof of trust', which would make another incentive for th e AEC business. As an example for transparency, In their research, (Nawari and Ravindran, 2019b) introduced a Blockchain+BIM framework for compliance and code -check automation of the review and submission of construction permits . 2.3. Traceability ( Provenance ) There is a major data loss problem in the construction indu stry (Branner, 2017) as 95% of data is either thrown out or not even collected . Provenance is one of the capabilities of Blockchain as it is a byproduct of its immutability, responsibility and accountability can be spotted, and also future risk can be anticipated if we can know where the error ca me from or who caused it (Xue and Lu, 2020) . In their paper, (Xue and Lu, 2020) referred to what they called “ Recent construction scandals ”, like the false results of testing “ Hong Kong -Zhuhai -Macau bridge ” or the improper construction in “ Hung H om MTR Station ”, adding that Blockc hain could’ve been the safeguard of building information provenance for forensic investigation purposes .
